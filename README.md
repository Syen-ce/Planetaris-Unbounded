# Welcome to Planetaris Unbounded

Discover new places of the universe, starting from Arig a desert planet with limited resources.

Arig is a hot planet with vast deserts where valuable resources can only be found underground or in the sand. Constant sandstorms make the use of robots unviable, and most of the surface is unsuitable for building without a proper foundation.

### Sifting

Sift large quantities of sand to extract basic ores.

# Future

My plans at the moment is to create a new set of planets with unique production lines that expand the space age game, as more planets and content is added i will change base game recipies and technologies to merge both experiences.

### Design process

The progression of the planets is not meant to be easy. Each planet introduces different restrictions to create a unique experience. For example, Arig makes it completely impossible to use any type of robot and limits building space until the right foundation is researched.

The next planet is already planned, and Iâ€™ll start working on it after fixing a few issues on Arig.

I'm completely open to suggestions and ideas. :)
